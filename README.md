# Monstrous Moonshine Presentation

An interactive presentation exploring the fascinating connection between the Monster Group and modular functions, known as Monstrous Moonshine.

## Overview

This presentation delves into one of the most surprising connections in mathematics, where the largest sporadic simple group (the Monster Group) appears to be intimately connected with modular functions and string theory. The presentation covers:

- Essential group theory background
- The Monster Group and its properties
- The discovery of Monstrous Moonshine
- Modular functions and the j-invariant
- String theory connections
- Modern developments in the field

## Features

- Interactive visualizations of group symmetries
- Mathematical formulas rendered with KaTeX
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation for easy presentation control
